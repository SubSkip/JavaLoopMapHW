## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA DEPENDENCIES` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-pack/blob/master/release-notes/v0.9.0.md#work-with-jar-files-directly).

## Submit: Loop Map

Loop and Map.Entry Exercises

Write a program that does the following:

- Asks the user for 5 numbers
- Stores them in an array list
- Finds the sum, product, largest, and smallest of those numbers

You are a car dealer. Create a hash map of vehicles.

- The model is the Key, the make is the Value.
- Ask the customer what car (model) they are looking for. Use the Hash Map to determine if you have that vehicle, and what make it is.
- (e.g. "Oh, you're looking for a Civic? Our Honda selection is right over here...")
